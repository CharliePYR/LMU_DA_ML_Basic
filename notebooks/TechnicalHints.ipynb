You can also use the alias which is easier to memorize (e.g. `katrin` for `cip-ws-102` etc.).\n",

In that case close the ssh connection and try running the above command again with the next higher port number (8081 and so on). For simplicity replace both occurrences of the port number in the `ssh` command, and remember to use this port number instead of 8080 when running the `jupyter` command in step 4.\n",
