    "## Problem 1: Mathematical model of an infectious disease\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "The SIR model (developed by W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick in 1927) is one of the simplest variants in a group of [compartmental models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) used in theoretical biology to model how an infectious disease spreads in a population in order to determine the likely outcome of an epidemic. The variables S, I and R represent the number of people in the compartments of the population and the differential equations describe the transition rates and thus flow between the compartments over time. When based on ODEs, the models are deterministic. (ODE = [ordinary differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation) = equality involving a function and its derivatives (may be of higher order but not partial derivatives).) For small populations, stochastic models that use Monte-Carlo methods are more realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The SIR model\n",
    "Consider the [SIR model](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIR-Modell) characterized through the following coupled system of first-order ordinary differential equations:\n",
    "* ${\\frac {dS}{dt}}=-c{\\frac {SI}{N}}$ \n",
    "* ${\\frac {dI}{dt}}=c{\\frac {SI}{N}}-wI$\n",
    "* ${\\frac {dR}{dt}}=wI$\n",
    "\n",
    "with the boundary condition that the total number of individuals N, which is the sum of S, I, and R, is constant\n",
    "* $N=S+I+R$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Obviously, the boundary condition is trivially fulfilled as the sum of the derivatives is zero, i.e. no births or deaths are included in this version of the model.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables and parameters of the model are:\n",
    "* $S$: number of susceptible individuals\n",
    "* $I$: number of infected individuals\n",
    "* $R$: number of recovered (resistant / removed) individuals\n",
    "* $c$: rate of disease transmission\n",
    "* $w$: rate of recovery \n",
    "* $t$: time (independent variable)"

    "$1/w$ can be interpreted as the average duration an individual is infecteous.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variations\n",
    "A more complex model with an interactive interface can be found [here](https://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html). \n",
    "It is based on SEIR with an additional compartment E = Exposed, and includes deaths and hospitalization. In addition to different sets of compartments, one can also consider spatial dependencies in addition to time."
